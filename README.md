# name-generator

I have a friend who lives in a Tiny House and has a difficult name to pronounce, it's an inside joke where i say his name in weird ways and call him a gipsy .
No offense intended to gipsy culture, it's juste a joke on the lifestyle of my friend.

I used for the images a picture of him that i found on facebook and sent to an IA, namely AI Gahaku available at https://ai-art.tokyo/en/ , it takes a picture and style it in 
a classical art style, 

I learnd:

<ul>
  <li>Afficher un élément aléatoire d'un array en utlisant [Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)]</li>
</ul>

Could be better with :

<ul>
  <li>Better UI and styling</li>
  <li>More images</li>
</ul>
